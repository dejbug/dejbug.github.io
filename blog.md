# Actions!

Working on my old vanity page https://github.com/dejbug/dejbug.github.io and having minor troubles navigating GH Actions. This is the lay of the land... #todo

## GH API

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs . Auth looks easy: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28 .


# Sublime Text!

Needed to run a shell command quickly. https://docs.sublimetext.io/reference/commands.html#exec  https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/build_systems.html#exec-target-options helped. The default build system wasn't good enough.

# CSS

It seems that the Adjacent Sibling Combinator https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator sees connections between two tags even when they're separated by some naked text. It is not even hinted at in these docs but is vaguely foreshadowed here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator> .
