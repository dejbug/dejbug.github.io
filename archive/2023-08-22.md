# Water, water

every where... and I almost dehydrated yesterday. Must try and take in more of the transparent stuff.

# archive.py

Being lazy I wanted to `make new` and archive the current blog page while creating a new one (the latter so that e.g. `ls -t --time=birth` would work). But then of course I came up with a couple more edge cases and the following (abridged) list of #toomanytabs came up.

I was surprised to find https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html and just had to use it here.

Next was the question of how to colorize it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors . https://pypi.org/project/colout/ https://github.com/nojhan/colout is probably just fine but I chose https://github.com/garabik/grc because it's #native and #non-AUR.

I wanted to simply pipe the output through a colorizer in the shell but then I thought, this is too simple not to do it directly. Saw how `grc` did it, which was very simple (and elegant). So simply took the relevant regexes out of its config script and presto.

The remaining issues was what if I page it through `less`. Turns out `less -R` is for that.

## Feature Request

I hate that the full path in the titlebar gets centered. It really needs to stay aligned so that one can quickly tell when one is ____crossing folder boundaries____. I just can't believe that nobody seems to look at it (otherwise there would have been a config setting by now to change it). I'm getting seasick trying to orient myself by it. :barfemoji:

# Zathura

So I'm using SciTE https://scintilla.org/SciTE.html for notes-taking, having written a couple Lua scripts https://www.scintilla.org/SciTELua.html https://www.scintilla.org/PaneAPI.html to make this possible. So I pop up my bookmarks file, put the caret over a filepath and press F12 on my mouse https://www.redragonzone.com/products/redragon-m908-rgb-gaming-mouse to open a document. But then I realize that I've switched my default reader to **zathura**

https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/
https://git.pwmt.org/pwmt/zathura/-/boards

recently and that the back/forward buttons on my mouse have now got screwy.

I have two buttons set to emit **pageup** / **pagedown** button presses and I have two buttons to emit **forward** / **backward** events.

So a couple of things happend all at once.

How do I set keybindings in zathura?

https://man.archlinux.org/man/zathura.1#MOUSE_AND_KEY_BINDINGS
https://man.archlinux.org/man/zathurarc.5.en

https://git.pwmt.org/pwmt/zathura/-/blob/develop/zathura/config.c
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/main/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h

Here, the **feedkeys** command is nice. `map <PageUp> feedkeys <C-u>` and `map <PageDown> feedkeys <C-d>` works.

What are the scancodes of those latter two? It turns out that running `showkey`on Arch fails; we need `sudo showkey` works. Also tldr; I need `xev` https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_input to get the **forward** / **backward** events to log. It's logged as **button8** / **button9**. Alas, `map <Button9> feedkeys <C-d>` doesn't work because zathura stops at Button5 https://man.archlinux.org/man/zathurarc.5.en#Mouse .

Using https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector?action=show&redirect=Projects%2FGTK%2B%2FInspector `gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.Debug enable-inspector-keybinding true` and `Control-Shift-D` showed me the name of the signal to connect to but writing my own GTK signal tracer a la `win.connect("button-press-event", cb)` didn't provide any new insights over and above `xev`. It's buttons 8 and 9 all the way https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/main/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h ; that's all there is to it, and there is no way to bind to them https://docs.gtk.org/gdk4/keys.html https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/key-bindings.html https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/method.Object.connect.html , apparently.

Now I was looking at ways to configure my Windows-supproting mouse in Linux.

I realize that blinkenlights https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights are very important to some people https://openrgb.org/ and that my mouse is popular enough https://openrgb.org/devices_0.9.html .

This though was very nice to see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMK
https://docs.qmk.fm/

And finally I landed here.

https://github.com/dokutan/mouse_m908
https://github.com/dokutan/mouse_m908/tree/master/documentation

And now I'm worried.

https://github.com/dokutan/mouse_m908#safety

I will have to look at the source https://github.com/dokutan/mouse_m908/tree/master/documentation and, at least to double-check, probably go myself and packetsniff https://vusb-analyzer.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html the windows app's https://www.winehq.org/ USB https://libusb.sourceforge.io/api-1.0/libusb_api.html protocol. And who knows, maybe the driver is simple enough to reverse? Though last time I did this was in 32-bit times. Things have changed a lot since then. https://valgrind.org/

# Window Managers

"Manajer, he manajer." -- Manuel (Fawlty Towers)

I need to get away from this bloated Desktop and use https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3 or https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/ .

# Archive.org

Using the web page to search for books is bothersome in that the "always available" needs to be ticked manually and there is no apparent advanced search option to set it. But one can set a bookmark in Firefox and give it a shortcut. For example https://archive.org/search?query=%s&and%5B%5D=lending%3A%22is_readable%22 with shortcut `a` and https://web.archive.org/20230000000000*/%s with shortcut `wb`.
