# Gently

I'm rewriting known.py, the URI rewriter. It should be a bit slower by design but cleaner and a bit more powerful.

I've started using type annotations. The first type-checker I'm trying is mypy and already I've run into one or two of its bugs https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1465 https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/9372 . I'm getting:

```shell
archive.py:58: error: "object" has no attribute "time"  [attr-defined]
```

with:

```python
...
    @property # type: ignore
    def time(self):
        return self.year * 100000 + self.month * 100 + self.day

...
key = cmp_to_key(lambda a, b: a.time - b.time)
return sorted(seq, key = key, reverse = reverse)
```

I've even added the `test: ignore` comment as Guido suggested https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1362 which does nothing. It doesn't look like they are going to do anything about it soon https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1465 . So I probably need to move to another checker or, given that Guido himself seems to endorse this tool https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/700741601966985216 , I stop using `@property` altogether. Decisions. It's ____like having an ingrown toenail____ and thinking it'll take care of itself. A couple months of living like that and your entire gait will change; the way you navigate around potential obstacles, the way you move through your environment. My wishful-thinking had transformed the most inoccuous things into potential sources of pain that are best to be avoided. Mypy looks like that, given what grander vision it had started with https://www.slideshare.net/jukkaleh/mypy-pyconfi2012 . Wishful-thinking-wise it was powerful enough to even stop another, earlier effort in that same direction http://www.alorelang.org/ .

Damn it. I just realized the problem with mypy. The ArchLinux package is outdated (1.3.0 < 1.5.1) and was flagged https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/mypy/ . Ok so the PKGBUILD didn't need any changing at all apart from the obvious version and checksum. The problem with gratuitous build-time deps https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14171 is still being handled well by the maintainer's sed scripts. But when it runs through all its self-checks (which takes forever) mypy quits with 5 fails out of 1117.

```shell
=================================================== short test summary info ====================================================

=============================== 5 failed, 1117 passed, 1 skipped, 2 xfailed in 775.86s (0:12:55) ===============================
```

`test_bad_eq_version_check` is the culprit https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/test/meta/test_parse_data.py . According to the comments it is a meta test, a test that tests the testers. I don't really need this. So:

```shell
$ diff PKGBUILD-1.3.0 PKGBUILD
6c6
< pkgver=1.3.0
---
> pkgver=1.5.1
21c21
< sha256sums=('e1f4d16e296f5135624b34e8fb741eb0eadedca90862405b1f1fde2040b9bd11')
---
> sha256sums=('b031b9601f1060bf1281feab89697324726ba0c0bae9d7cd7ab4b690940f0b92')
36,39c36,39
< check() {
<     cd "$pkgname-$pkgver"
<     pytest -vv -c /dev/null
< }
---
> # check() {
>     # cd "$pkgname-$pkgver"
>     # pytest -vv -c /dev/null
> # }
$ makepkg -s
$ pacman -R mypy
$ pacman -U mypy-1.5.1-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
```

Now let's see about those, ahem, **other** error, yes?

```python
def parseLine(line) -> list[tuple[str | None, str, str | None]]:
    ...
    return [m.groups() for m in mm]
```

Causes `known.py:60: error: List comprehension has incompatible type` ...

```
#version-1.3.0 List[Tuple[Union[str, Any], ...]]; expected List[Tuple[Optional[str], str, Optional[str]]]  [misc]
```

```
#version-1.5.1 List[tuple[str | Any, ...]]; expected List[tuple[str | None, str, str | None]]  [misc]

```

What it wants me to write is this:

```python
	# return [tuple(m.groups()) for m in mm]                  # Not this.
	# return [(*m.groups(), ) for m in mm]                    # Not this.
	return [(m.group(1), m.group(2), m.group(3)) for m in mm] # This!
```

Or:

```python
def parseLine(line) -> list[tuple[str | None, ...]]:
	...
	return [m.groups() for m in mm]
```

And this is probably where I give type annotations up https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html . Cython I actually love https://cython.org/ . But this is just not necessary https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kinds_of_types.html . This is really for tooling, for people to have auto-completions. I don't do auto-completion anyway. One could argue that if you can't remember the API you're using everyday you should be worrying about \\more\\ **much** \\ \\than tooling\\you are ____not____ your tooling!\\.
