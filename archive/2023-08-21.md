# Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!

Today went by too quickly. I've finally managed to draw the pairings https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C0403 for the first round of our tournament https://springerbk.de/meister-23.html . Using a FIDE-approved tool https://spp.fide.com/c-04-a-appendix-endorsement-of-a-software-program/ , https://spp.fide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/C04Annex3_FEP19.pdf .

Sure, there were a couple python libs

But I don't trust them. I chose https://github.com/BieremaBoyzProgramming/bbpPairings over http://www.rrweb.org/javafo/JaVaFo.htm , though the docs are the same as http://www.rrweb.org/javafo/aum/JaVaFo2_AUM.htm . It uses a machine-readable input format https://ratings.fide.com/download/fidexchg.txt , https://handbook.fide.com/files/handbook/fidexchg.txt , https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/C04Annex2_TRF16.pdf . Examples: http://www.rrweb.org/javafo/aum/TRFXSample.txt and http://www.rrweb.org/javafo/aum/RankedTRFXSample2.txt . So basically I will have to write an interface for it #trf.interface.

# Arbiter

I really need to read the Arbiter's Manual https://arbiters.fide.com/news/7742 and FIDE Handbook https://handbook.fide.com/ . I shall hang out at https://spp.fide.com/objectives/ a bit.

There is so much to do! I was counting 1178 open tabs https://github.com/dejbug/tablist when I remembered that there really should have been another tablister, a bit more capable https://github.com/dejbug/ff-tab-lister/ , of mine to be found on moz-addons https://github.com/dejbug/tablist and yet it's gone! I wonder what was wrong with it. It must have been a compatibility issue with the new SDK. Of course. _I was using the *config* store which no longer exists_.

# It's been a while!

And I've been neglecting JS. I used to hate it since Netspace. Now they gave it template literals https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals but it still has no printf https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Text_formatting . http://es6-features.org/ https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features

But I looked at tablister again and thought about adding a gui to it https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface and then fiddled around and got carried away a bit and ended up with rubbish code https://github.com/dejbug/tablist/tree/dev . Todo!

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Extension_pages
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface

I shall get back into extensions development. I need an URL up-and-down counter for archive.org. Also a badge shall show in my toolbar if there's a DJVU version of a book in the downloads without me having to navigate to it.

Some official best-practice patterns: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Grid_wrapper .

Stylish https://stylestage.dev/styles/ and nice https://styleshout.com/ .

I like web components https://github.com/mdn/web-components-examples/tree/main/defined-pseudo-class . It's one of the things that drew me back to web dev.

This is on my #todo list.

Did we really need https://mermaid.js.org/ a better graphviz https://graphviz.org/ ?

# GUI

I used to write in native Win32 API because the MFC had too much magic going on. It was a framework which you couldn't use without understanding what it abstracted away for you. It was self-defeating. ATL was better. I loved Don Box's book on COM. I was fond of Microsoft back then. Afterwards it was easy to switch to wxWidgets and later to https://www.wxpython.org/ https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/ .

At my last job interview they wanted me to sue Qt and Java. I wanted to look into it https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt , https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python but chose to go full pineapple bananas and write for Xorg https://www.x.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation/ directly https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html , at the very least for GTK.

I then looked through the Python wiki https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming for what else is new and found something truly stunning. Apparently there are quite a few additions to the python GUI ecosystem. Yes, Tkinter is shipped with it but it's not a joy to write for it.

ImGUI used to be the rage for OpenGL. Now this. https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-dearpygui .

But this just blew my mind. https://pypi.org/project/nicegui/#description
https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/DEPENDENCIES.md . It's inspired by https://justpy.io/ https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-justpy they say. Which, too, was news to me. Now *this* is awesome! https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ and this https://www.starlette.io/ ( "Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building async web services in Python." ) and *this* https://www.uvicorn.org/ . Also https://github.com/python/mypy ( "Static Typing for Python" ) and https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/ ( "Pydantic is the most widely used data validation library for Python" ) .

This is cute https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html . They overrode the division operator to easily concatenate paths.

	"Now, so far as the spirit which is certain of itself, in the form
	of a “beautiful soul”, does not possess the strength to relinquish the
	self-absorbed uncommunicative knowledge of itself, it cannot attain to
	any identity with the consciousness that is repulsed, and so cannot
	succeed in seeing the unity of its self in another life, cannot reach
	objective existence. The identity comes about, therefore, merely in a
	negative way, as a state of being devoid of spiritual character."

I need to learn to use these https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects project management tools. I need to organize my time better. I need to get an overview, assume a vantage point,  surface, find some air to breathe.
