# Actions!

Working on my old vanity page https://github.com/dejbug/dejbug.github.io and having minor troubles navigating GH Actions. This is the lay of the land... #todo

## GH API

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-jobs . Auth looks easy: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28 .

# Sublime Text!

Needed to run a shell command quickly. https://docs.sublimetext.io/reference/commands.html#exec  https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/build_systems.html#exec-target-options helped. The default build system wasn't good enough.

# CSS

It seems that the Adjacent Sibling Combinator https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator sees connections between two tags even when they're separated by some naked text. It is not even hinted at in these docs but is vaguely foreshadowed here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator> .

# Parser

## ANTLR char classes are nice!

# Python

I just hope that somewhere there's a flame-war raging about Python's choice of string encode/decode terminology. They chose to call the move from bytes to strings "decode" instead of "encode"; from the more general to the more specific; from the source to the interpretation. Like there's only one true way of converting a binary stream.

The blob is the more primal thing.

# Blog

For my blog I will need to write an ANTLR grammar (done!) and use it to parse the blog more properly. SED/AWK seem inadequate, but that may be my lack of erudition. Could have used a perl script maybe. Flex/Bison, which is what I've used a lot in the past would require me to use ctypes (which isn't too bad and just a bit more typing work) while I'd like a pure Python solution here.

I need to add an inline markdown parser (for stuff like what is following in this page's source file).

# Firefox

I'm looking to override the default Ctrl+Q hotkey https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/keyboard_shortcuts/index.html to just close the active tab instead of kill the app. I remembered two things from the distant past. 1. userChrome.css (analogously perhaps a userChrome.js?) 2. you could load firefox inside itself like you would load a page (chrome://.../.xul, or something). The latter being obviously useful in the case the first exists.

I've looked for the firefox files `pacman -Ql firefox` and found the largest file `file /usr/lib/firefox/omni.ja` to be a zip. So for example, inside there is a file "license.html" `find . -iname 'license*'` which can be loaded like a page "chrome://browser/content/license.html" . And indeed one can load any files from the folder like for instance "./chrome/browser/content/browser/aboutRobots-icon.png" like so: "chrome://browser/content/aboutRobots-icon.png".

So either there is some logic by convention in the path naming (reversed in the url?) or there must be a manifest file to map the filesystem to uris.

/home/.../.mozilla/firefox/.../chrome/userChrome.css

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Keyconfig_extension:_Firefox

I still haven't found how to load firefox inside it. Maybe the code has changed too much since back in the day when picture-in-picture was all the rage.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Extending_the_developer_tools

Long story short. I've just peeked inside `about:config` and found `browser.quitShortcut.disabled`(restart needed). Somebody at Mozilla must have had the same problem as I (inconsistent shortcuts across apps causing inermittent havoc).
