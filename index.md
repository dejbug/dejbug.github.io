Sir. Her Maty fynding that the lawes of the realm do not cary severity enough to represse the insolency of all sortes of fellows, the number wherof by such meanes doth daily increase, yt hath pleased her of late to devise that such offendors, being repryved from execution, shalbe bestowed in her gallyes, wherof one is already built, and more are meant to be built; the use of which kind of punishment will both terrify ill disposed persons from offending, and make thos that shall hazard them selves to offend in some sorte proffitable to the common wealthe.
