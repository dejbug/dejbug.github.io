# Useless

Don't know why, don't know if it'd make any difference if I did know why, but I just can't get myself to look at all this paperwork I have. I don't want to touch it. I neither wish to feel nor smell the paper. I don't want to read the language. This instrument of bureaucrats. Every year the same routine. Every year nothing whatsoever changes. An unwelcome reminder that I live on borrowed time.

# Tonight

I need to fill it out tonight. I need to walk it over to the Landratsamt and throw it in the mailbox there. So there is a chance they'll be looking at it in the morning. The deadline is the end of the month. That's how long I have avoided doing it. When all they really need to know is that nothing's changed. When all they really have to do is click a button. But this paperwork is the air we breathe, the substrate of the world we share, the way we know that we exist. There is no way around it. Welfare propagates at the speed of paperwork. Progress equals paperwork squared.

# Future

I get glimpses now and then of a parallel universe, an alternate reality, a quantum tunnel out of here. Again there was a stranger's WhatsApp message. A recruiter or someone pretending to be one, reaching out to me. It did make me feel a bit more optimistic for a minute. I don't know where they're getting my number from. It's flattering. This tiny bit of effort that they've made. To pull me back. To make me part of something greater than myself.

# Merology

For some reason they even knew that I'm incapable of grinding out a full-time job and had made sure to mention the possibility of a part-time gig. I like that. I almost wrote them back. But I'm hopeless; and I'm devoid of hope. I will not waste their time nor mine. The only thing that keeps me going is that I am free to give it all up on a whim. That nothing, nobody depends on me. It's called falling asleep because you have to give it up. All of it, which is to say your self. It's the only way that I can get a full night's worth of rest. Pretending that I won't wake up. Pretending that not waking up on time won't matter because nothing ever will.

# Integrity

These are the times when I must set up shop in bed, doing nothing in particular, just breathing, just staring at the backside of my lids. Feeling half-forgotten. This last part is important. If I'd keep thinking of deadlines I just wouldn't be able to relax. I might be lying down but I'd be bleeding energy. In any case, you can't write a CV entirely with filler phrases. Stuffing needs something to stuff. There's no chance that anyone would hire me just for showing up. This is not how I assume the world to function.

# Occupation

MDD has cut a huge swath out of my allotted time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8 Coding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language and, to a lesser extent, chess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game were two of the three obsessions that kept me hoping to wake up again each night. Which reminds me that I need to prepare an opening for tomorrow's match; the second round of our club's championship.

# Commitment

I used to think that all this procrastination was just the final form of an adolescent fear of commitment. Today I think it's something else entirely. It's some sort of disconnect, of course. Like sitting in the front row of the theater. Proper immersion requires a certain distance to the fantasy. Try watching your favorite movie scenes without the soundtrack. Try watching it dubbed into German. Or try it in Italian, if you happen to be German. It's the sound that sets the mood. That tells you how to feel about those faces, walls, and spaces. It is the invisible that animates the visible. Listen closely, for you are at the threshold of religion here. Faith, otherwise known as the suspension of disbelief.

# Devolution

Why is playing chess so difficult? Because we can't evaluate a future we don't see. Because if we could imagine perfectly, why would we ever try to find a mate? Were not the most successful propagators of our species the ones who needed to surround themselves with what they felt to be desirable? Objects of beauty. Eidetic crutches. Because if closing our eyes would fail extinguishing the light fantastic, how could we ever fall asleep? And is death not just another way of saying psychical exhaustion? Listen to this:

# Night

It's 2 am. If I fill the forms out now I'll be outside during witching hour. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witching_hour I would like that very much. It would imbue this routine administrative paperwork with a certain aura of whatever the opposite of mind-numbingly boring is. But I am so tired. And my bowels feel as if they've knotted themselves up. Tiamat is restless. Let's waste one more day. Just one more day? I'm sounding like a dying man, begging for more time.
